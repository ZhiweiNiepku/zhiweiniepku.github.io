Zhiwei Nie is the PhD candidate at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) and [School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/) of Peking University.
He conducts research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural sciences, with a particular focus on developing biomolecule foundation models and their applications in function prediction and protein engineering.
His work has been published in journals including Nature Machine Intelligence, IJCAI, IJHPCA, and BIB, and covered by such outlets as the Sina Interview (over a million hits), Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), ScienceNet China, World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC), and Shanghai Association for Science & Tech.
He is the recipient of more than thirty international honors, including 2025 “Rising Scientist” (five people worldwide each year) by the CAAI, the World Artificial Intelligence Conference Youth Outstanding Paper Award (ten people worldwide each year), the Best Paper Award from the Journal of Materials Informatics, and Wiley’s Top Downloaded Paper Award.
